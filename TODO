Create factories to generate random teams, clubs, players

Game class ideas:
    - possession
        - this could be worked out based on all of the above events?
    - player position when an action occurs

Manager class
    - Team is managed by a manager

Formation classes
    - team has a formation
    - formation is made up of players

Think about how to deal with offside
    - need to know all player positions when actions happen
    - maybe player positions should be recorded independently of game actions?
    - or maybe there should be an action for players that are not directly involved 
    in the current play. Every second we could record each players PlayerPosition action?
